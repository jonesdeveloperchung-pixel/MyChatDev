## 2025-10-31 - Test Plan and Debugging

### Objective
- Outline a comprehensive test plan for the MyChatDev system.
- Generate sample unit test programs.
- Address existing errors in the test suite.

### Progress
1.  **Comprehensive Test Plan:** Developed a detailed test plan covering Unit, Integration, End-to-End, Performance, and Robustness testing.
2.  **Unit Test Program Example:** Created `tests/test_sandbox.py` with extensive unit tests for the `Sandbox` class.
3.  **Debugging Test Suite Errors:** Encountered and addressed several issues during the process of running the existing and new test files:

    *   **`NameError: name 'USER_PROFILES_DIR' is not defined` in `cli.py`**:
        - **Cause:** `USER_PROFILES_DIR` was not globally defined in `cli.py` when accessed by profile management functions.
        - **Fix:** Defined `USER_PROFILES_DIR` globally in `cli.py` by calling `get_user_profiles_dir()` at the module level.
        - **Verification:** `python cli.py profile list` and `python cli.py profile show <profile_name>` now execute without this error.

    *   **`SyntaxError: invalid syntax` in `tests/test_cli.py` and `tests/test_graph_workflow.py`**:
        - **Cause:** Multi-line `with patch` statements were not correctly enclosed in parentheses, leading to syntax errors during test collection.
        - **Fix:** Modified the `with patch` statements in `tests/test_cli.py` and `tests/test_graph_workflow.py` to correctly use parentheses for multi-line context managers.
        - **Verification:** These `SyntaxError`s are no longer reported.

    *   **`ImportError: cannot import name 'AVAILABLE_LLMS' from 'config.settings'` in `tests/test_quality_gate.py` and `tests/test_graph_workflow.py`**:
        - **Cause:** `AVAILABLE_LLMS` was incorrectly imported from `config.settings` instead of `config.llm_profiles`.
        - **Fix:** Corrected the import statement in both files to `from config.llm_profiles import AVAILABLE_LLMS_BY_PROFILE`.
        - **Verification:** This `ImportError` is no longer reported.

    *   **`KeyError: 'quality_gate'` in `tests/test_graph_workflow.py` and `tests/test_quality_gate.py`**:
        - **Cause:** The `llm_configs` fixture in these test files was returning `AVAILABLE_LLMS_BY_PROFILE` (the full dictionary of profiles), but the `quality_gate` fixture expected a dictionary of `LLMConfig` objects for a specific profile.
        - **Fix:** Modified the `llm_configs` fixture in both `tests/test_graph_workflow.py` and `tests/test_quality_gate.py` to return `AVAILABLE_LLMS_BY_PROFILE["High_Reasoning"]` (or another specific profile) to provide the expected structure.
        - **Verification:** This `KeyError` is no longer reported.

    *   **`PytestUnknownMarkWarning: Unknown pytest.mark.asyncio`**:
        - **Cause:** The `pytest-asyncio` plugin was not installed.
        - **Fix:** Installed `pytest-asyncio` using `pip install pytest-asyncio`.
        - **Verification:** This warning is no longer reported.

    *   **`IndentationError: unexpected indent` in `tests/test_cli.py`**:
        - **Cause:** An `IndentationError` was encountered in the `tmp_dirs` fixture, specifically related to the `yield` statement, possibly due to complex multi-line `with` statement parsing or incorrect indentation.
        - **Fix:** Simplified the `with patch` statement in the `tmp_dirs` fixture to a single line to avoid multi-line parsing issues. Also, ensured `import time` was at the top level.
        - **Verification:** This `IndentationError` is no longer reported.

    *   **`PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access is denied`**:
        - **Cause:** This is a common issue on Windows with `pytest`'s `tmp_path` fixture, often due to file handles not being released quickly enough or antivirus interference.
        - **Fix:** Added `import time` and `time.sleep(0.1)` before `shutil.rmtree` in the `tmp_dirs` fixture in `tests/test_cli.py` to allow time for file handles to be released.
        - **Verification:** This error is still present in the latest test run.

    *   **`FAILED tests/test_cli.py::test_cli_main_no_command - assert 0 == 1`**:
        - **Cause:** The `run_cli_and_capture_output` helper function was not correctly capturing the exit code from `SystemExit` when `sys.exit` was called.
        - **Fix:** Adjusted `run_cli_and_capture_output` to correctly extract the exit code from `mock_exit.call_args[0][0]` if `mock_exit.called` is true.
        - **Verification:** This failure is still present.

    *   **`FAILED tests/test_cli.py::test_cli_main_unknown_command - assert 0 == 2`**:
        - **Cause:** Same as above.
        - **Fix:** Same as above.
        - **Verification:** This failure is still present.

    *   **`FAILED tests/test_cli.py::test_run_command_help - AssertionError: assert 'Execute the cooperative LLM workflow' in <MagicMock name='stdout.getvalue()' id='...'>`**:
        - **Cause:** The `stdout` was not being captured correctly by the `MagicMock` or the help message content was not as expected.
        - **Fix:** Re-examined the `run_cli_and_capture_output` function and the assertion.
        - **Verification:** This failure is still present.

    *   **`FAILED tests/test_llm_manager.py` (multiple failures)**:
        - **Cause:** Mocks for `ollama` client responses were not correctly configured, and `compress_content` was missing a required argument. Default values for `LLMConfig` and `SystemConfig` had changed.
        - **Fix:**
            - Updated `test_check_model_availability_success` to ensure `mock_list.return_value` correctly reflects a successful model check.
            - Updated `test_generate_response_success` to ensure `mock_chat_method.return_value` correctly simulates a streamed response.
            - Updated `test_compress_content_...` tests to pass a mock `distiller_config`.
            - Updated assertions for `max_tokens` and `max_iterations` to match current default values in `config/settings.py`.
        - **Verification:** These failures are still present.

### Next Steps
- Re-run tests to confirm `KeyError` fixes.
- Further investigate and resolve the `PermissionError` (potentially by refactoring `tmp_dirs` fixture or using `tmpdir_factory`).
- Address the remaining `FAILED` tests in `test_cli.py` and `test_llm_manager.py`.
