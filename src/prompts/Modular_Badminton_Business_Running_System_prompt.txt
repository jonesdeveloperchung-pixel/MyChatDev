## 🏸 Modular Badminton Business Running System

A cross-platform, extensible system supporting GUI and headless execution. It manages court rentals, player scoring, badminton-ware shopping, and equipment maintenance with telemetry-ready outputs and onboarding-friendly documentation.

---

### 1. 🎛️ Interactive Input Interface

Supports user-defined inputs across modules:

#### a. Court Reservation
- Date/time, duration, court type (indoor/outdoor)
- Player count, skill level, preferred lighting/flooring
- Payment method, membership status

#### b. Match Setup
- Player profiles (name, age, skill rating)
- Match type (singles/doubles), scoring rules (21-point, rally scoring)
- Referee assignment, live scoreboard toggle

#### c. Shopping & Maintenance
- Product filters (rackets, shoes, shuttlecocks, apparel)
- Equipment condition reports (wear level, string tension, grip status)
- Maintenance scheduling (auto-reminders, technician assignment)

---

### 2. ⚙️ Automated Computation Engine

Handles real-time calculations and business logic:

#### a. Reservation Engine
- Conflict detection, dynamic pricing (peak/off-peak)
- Loyalty discounts, refund policies, waitlist prioritization

#### b. Scoring Engine
- Live score tracking with undo/redo
- Player stats aggregation (win/loss ratio, average rally length)
- Match history export (JSON, CSV)

#### c. Inventory & Maintenance Engine
- Stock level monitoring, reorder triggers
- Equipment lifecycle tracking (usage hours, last maintenance)
- Predictive maintenance alerts based on wear models

---

### 3. 🧩 Modular Solver Architecture

Inspired by analytical/empirical modeling:

#### a. Reservation Solver
- Optimizes court allocation using time-slot packing and player clustering

#### b. Scoring Solver
- Validates scoring against official rulesets (BWF compliance)
- Supports custom rule modules (e.g., training drills, mini-games)

#### c. Maintenance Solver
- Uses empirical wear models to estimate next service date
- Matches technician availability with equipment needs

---

### 4. 📡 Telemetry-Ready Output Layer

Structured exports and visualizations:

- Reservation logs, player stats, match summaries
- Inventory turnover charts, maintenance schedules
- JSON/CSV exports for integration with ERP/CRM systems
- Optional dashboards: court utilization heatmaps, player performance graphs

---

### 5. 📚 Onboarding-Friendly Documentation

Includes:

- Embedded design rationale for each module
- Compliance notes (e.g., BWF rules, local safety standards)
- Reproducible workflows for match setup, scoring, and maintenance
- Role-specific onboarding guides (admin, referee, technician, shopkeeper)

---

### 6. 🧪 Production-Ready Engineering

- ✅ Unit-tested modules (Rust for performance-critical logic, Python for orchestration/UI)
- ✅ Integration tests across reservation, scoring, and shopping workflows
- ✅ GUI (PyQt or Tauri) and CLI support for headless execution
- ✅ Modular plugin system for future enhancements (e.g., AI match prediction, AR scoreboard)
