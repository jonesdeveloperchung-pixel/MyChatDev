## **Sentinel PC Monitor – Lightweight Remote Monitoring Tool**

### **1. Core Concept**
Sentinel PC Monitor is a streamlined remote monitoring and control tool for individual PCs. It emphasizes **minimal system resource usage**, **simple remote visualization**, and **essential control features** for low-bandwidth or constrained environments.

---

### **2. User Interface (UI)**

- **Compact Dashboard:** Displays essential KPIs (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network traffic) using lightweight SVG-based charts. Optional modules for temperature and power if supported by hardware.
- **Simplified Device View:** Presents metrics with fixed time ranges (e.g., last 1h, 6h, 24h) to reduce rendering overhead.
- **Alerts Panel:** Shows active alerts and basic history. Alert configuration is limited to key metrics to reduce complexity.
- **Remote Control Panel:** Provides basic remote actions (reboot, shutdown, run predefined scripts) with confirmation prompts.
- **Report Export (Optional):** Generates lightweight CSV reports for selected metrics. PDF export deferred to future versions.

### **3. Key Features & Functionality**

- **Efficient Data Collection Agent:**
  - Written in Go (preferred for performance) or Python (for ease of development).
  - Polling intervals configurable (default: every 10 seconds).
  - Uses OS-native APIs to avoid heavy dependencies.

- **Basic Alerting System:**
  - Threshold-based alerts for CPU, memory, disk, and network.
  - Notifications via lightweight in-app messages or webhook integration (email optional).

- **Remote Command Execution:**
  - Supports basic commands only (reboot, shutdown, run script).
  - Scripts must be predefined and whitelisted for safety.

- **Historical Logging (Optional):**
  - Stores last 7 days of data in local SQLite (default).
  - PostgreSQL support available for extended logging.

- **Secure Communication:**
  - HTTPS with optional TLS certificate pinning.
  - Minimal handshake overhead for low-bandwidth environments.

- **Role-Based Access (Simplified):**
  - Two roles: Admin (full control), Viewer (read-only).
  - Local config file or token-based access control.

### **4. Technical Specifications**

| Component         | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Backend Server** | Node.js + Express.js with optional PostgreSQL or SQLite for data storage. |
| **Monitoring Agent** | Go (preferred) or Python, cross-platform, <10MB footprint.                  |
| **Communication** | HTTPS with optional compression (gzip).                                     |
| **Frontend**      | React with minimal dependencies, optimized for low-memory devices.         |

### **5. Planned Integrations (Deferred for Resource-Constrained Deployments)**

- **Cloud Sync (Optional):** Integration with AWS/Azure for centralized dashboards.
- **Automation (Optional):** Task scheduling for updates, cleanup, etc., using cron-style rules.

### **6. Technology Stack Summary**

| Layer      | Technology         |
|------------|--------------------|
| Frontend   | React (lightweight build) |
| Backend    | Node.js, Express.js |
| Database   | SQLite (default), PostgreSQL (optional) |
| Agent      | Go / Python         |

### **Design Notes for Low-Resource Environments**

- **Agent footprint <10MB**, CPU usage <2% during idle.
- **Dashboard loads in <2s** on remote connections.
- **No background services** unless explicitly enabled.
- **All modules optional** and can be disabled via config.
