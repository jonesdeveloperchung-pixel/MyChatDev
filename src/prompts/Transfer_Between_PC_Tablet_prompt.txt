Develop a pair of cross‑platform utilities that measure and verify maximum data transfer speeds over USB, Wi‑Fi, and Bluetooth between tablet devices (iOS and Android) and PCs running Windows, Linux, or macOS. The tools should allow you to confirm that data is reliably transmitted and meets expected rates between the tablet and each desktop operating system. Ideally, deliver a single solution that functions seamlessly across all these platforms.
