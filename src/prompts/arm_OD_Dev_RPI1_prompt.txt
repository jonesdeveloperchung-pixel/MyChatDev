Design and implement a bootable, modular Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) for Raspberry Pi 1 (ARM1176JZF-S) using Rust, Assembly, and C, without relying on third-party components or external libraries. The system must include:

1. Bare-metal initialization of the ARMv6 CPU, MMU, and interrupt controller via a custom Assembly bootloader loaded by the Pi firmware (`bootcode.bin` and `start.elf`)
2. Direct hardware probing and initialization of onboard peripherals (e.g., GPIO, UART, USB) using memory-mapped I/O and manual register manipulation
3. A minimal GUI subsystem that configures the framebuffer via mailbox interface and displays a static string onscreen (e.g., "Welcome to Pi RTOS") using bitmap font rendering
4. A cooperative task scheduler with configurable priorities and timing constraints, defined via flat configuration files or hardcoded tables
5. Kernel-level logging and structured telemetry output via UART or framebuffer overlay, with no external storage dependencies

The RTOS must be bootable from an SD card, include a minimal Assembly bootloader that transitions to Rust-based kernel execution, and support C interop for low-level routines. The system should be self-contained and production-ready, featuring onboarding-friendly documentation, integration tests, and reproducible builds via cross-compilation and QEMU emulation.
